          This presents a challenge: you may not be able to meet candidates
          face-to-face to interview them, or to carry out skills tests. If you
          find yourself needing to hire and conduct interviews whilst working
          remotely, you can use video interviews to do so. This article will
          focus on conducting real-time ‘face-to-face’ interviews.

        <h2 className="chapter-title">What is a video interview?</h2>
        <p>
          Even before the breakout of the virus, working in international
          education may haven meant that you had already started using video
          interviewing as part of the interview process. These interviews can be
          conducted either as a live ‘face-to-face’ interview (via Skype, Zoom,
          Hangouts or similar), or by an asynchronous interview where a
          candidate is video-recorded online, answering a set series of
          recruiter or client provided questions. This video will then be
          provided to you to review.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Randstad, we already use video interviewing to support our clients
          in the recruitment process. For example, we have provided a diverse
          range of international and UK based candidate asynchronous interviews
          to clients for review. Some of these were part of our commercial
          partnership with the Department for Education, where we are supporting
          the recruitment of language teachers from abroad. We used this
          technology to support placing 75 MFL teachers in English schools in
          the academic year 2019/20.

          How to conduct a successful video interview
        </h2>
        <p>
          If you choose to conduct a live ‘face-to-face’ video interview, here
          are some tips on ensuring that you both conduct a successful interview
          and find the right candidate for the role.
        </p>
        <h2 className="chapter-title">Choose how to conduct your interview</h2>
        <p>
          Once you have decided that you want to interview your candidate in
          real-time rather than by an asynchronous interview, you need to pick
          the right technology platform. There are a number of options
          available, such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Skype</li>
          <li>BlueJeans</li>
          <li>FaceTime</li>
          <li>GoToMeeting</li>
          <li>Google Meet</li>
          <li>Zoom</li>
          <li>Microsoft Teams</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Some of these platforms also allow for conference interviews, so if
          required multiple interviewers can speak to a candidate at one time.
          You will need to consider that not all candidates will have access to
          certain tools, so make sure they are aware of all details beforehand
          and have the right software to hand, and be prepared to be flexible if
          needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is also worth considering that you may want to record the interview
          so that you can watch it back afterwards, so make sure that your
          chosen platform allows for this. You will also need to gain the
          candidate’s consent for this beforehand.
        </p>
        <h2 className="chapter-title">Test your tech</h2>
        <p>
          No one wants to be that person who is late to a meeting because they
          couldn’t get their laptop to work, or accidentally transforms
          themselves into a potato for the duration of the call! Just as you
          would expect from your interviewee, do your best to counteract any
          tech difficulties by doing a test run of the software and ensuring
          that all laptops or phones are charged.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is also a good idea to take steps to avoid being disturbed
          throughout the interview, particularly if you are working from home
          with family or friends. This will ensure that you avoid a Professor
          Robert Kelly on the BBC situation where his children decided to join
          in the interview!
        </p>
        <h2 className="chapter-title">Prepare questions in advance</h2>
        <p>
          It sounds basic, but there is no reason why any other element of your
          interview should change. The style and format can remain the same,
          which means a set of pre-prepared questions just as you would ask in a
          face-to-face interview. These will likely be a mixture of technical
          and behavioural, dependent on the role, but ensure you have read these
          through beforehand and have them to hand throughout.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our employer brand research suggests that 96% people make decisions on
          where they want to work based on an organisation’s culture. With this
          in mind, if you can, try and get your company culture across in the
          interview.
        </p>
        <p>
          This can be challenging without an office background and colleagues to
          introduce – but you can still try to convey it over video. For
          example, if you’re looking to reflect your organisation’s corporate
          environment, consider wearing more formal clothes. Conversely, if you
          have a more casual workplace, reflect this in your attire. You can
          also set aside some time to explain to the candidate in more detail
          the kind of values you stand for, the qualities you look for in
          prospective employees and what day-to-day life looks like in the
          office. Make sure you ask them if they have any questions about this
          too.
        </p>
        <h2 className="chapter-title">Take notes throughout</h2>
        <p>
          Even if you are recording the interview, making notes throughout the
          interview can make the candidate feel as if they are being listened
          to, whilst making the interview reflect an in-person interview as much
          as possible. It is also good for you to make a note of your initial
          gut reaction to the candidate. Make sure that you don’t let this
          diminish your engagement with the candidate though.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can make notes on the candidate’s responses, or use an interview
          scorecard to assess how well they are answering. It is important to
          also take notice throughout on how the candidate is communicating to
          you – are they speaking in a professional manner or are they more
          informal? Look at their body language, level of engagement and
          consider the environment in which they have chosen to be interviewed.
        </p>
        <h2 className="chapter-title">Make time to review</h2>
        <p>
          After the interview, take some time to review any notes you made,
          along with any recordings, and whether there is any information you
          need to clarify further. If you are interviewing multiple candidates
          for the same role, it may also help you to compare notes across these
          candidates.
