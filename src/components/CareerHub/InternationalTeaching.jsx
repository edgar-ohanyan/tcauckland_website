        <h2 className="chapter-title">FAQs:</h2>

        <h2 className="chapter-title-secondary">
          Why should I work in an international school?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The reasons to teach internationally are too many to list and can vary
          depending on where you end up working but the main reasons people
          choose to work overseas include having a cultural experience, better
          work-life balance, being able to save money, opportunities for career
          development, the ability to learn a new language and simply being
          somewhere with nicer weather… Really the question is “Why shouldn’t
          you work in an international school?”.
        </p>

        <h2 className="chapter-title-secondary">
          How do I get an international job?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Talk to Teachanywhere! We are experts in knowing what international
          schools look for and our lovely consultants will guide and support you
          through the entire process. We partner with the best international
          schools all over the world and have been doing so for years - we’ll
          make sure you end up somewhere you’ll be safe, happy and fulfilled.
        </p>

        <h2 className="chapter-title-secondary">
          What qualifications do I need?
        </h2>
        <p>
          This can vary greatly depending on job, school and country but the
          bare minimum you need is to be a fully qualified teacher (PGCE, BEd or
          equivalent) - if you don’t meet this requirement you may want to look
          into TEFL teaching, but that’s not something Teachanywhere currently
          helps with. If you are an NQT you should be aware that your options
          will be very limited until you have at least 2 years
          post-qualification experience. Also, the schools we work with are all
          English-speaking and so if you aren’t a native English speaker it can
          also limit your options.
        </p>

        <h2 className="chapter-title-secondary">
          What are the visa restrictions and laws?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Every country is different. For example some countries don’t have a
          minimum experience requirement for visas, most have a two- or
          three-year minimum requirement but for some it’s as much as five
          years! In some places you have to be specifically qualified in what
          you want to teach and your Bachelors degree may be taken into account
          (eg. if you want to teach Maths in the UAE you’ll need both your PGCE
          and Bachelors degree in Mathematics). You should also be aware of what
          laws you will need to abide by in your new country. If you have any
          specific questions about this get in touch with us!
        </p>

        <h2 className="chapter-title-secondary">
          What sort of schools do you work with?
        </h2>
        <p>
          We work with a whole range of international and bilingual schools all
          over the world. They teach different curriculums (the most common are
          UK, US, Australian and International Baccalaureate) but all will have
          you teaching in English and covering subjects in the same way you
          would back home. They can be part of larger groups of international
          schools, offshoots of British or American school networks as well as
          individual schools and government projects.
        </p>

        <h2 className="chapter-title-secondary">
          Where are the best places to go?
        </h2>
        <p>
          This is very subjective and will depend a lot on who you are and what
          you want, but a good general answer is the best places are often the
          places where the least people want to go. There are so many people
          saying they want Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Spain, Hong Kong, Thailand and
          Singapore that the majority of people who want to go there won’t be
          successful and the people who do go there often have to make some
          large sacrifices including lower salaries and working in more
          difficult schools. It’s worth remembering that you’ll probably have a
          much better time getting paid more and working in a great school
          somewhere you haven’t considered yet than on a low salary dealing with
          a not-so-great school somewhere that you’ve been on holiday! Some of
          the really up-and-coming places are China, Kazakhstan, Kuwait and
          Qatar - but there are plenty of others too!
        </p>

        <h2 className="chapter-title-secondary">
          What are the salaries and benefits?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Another thing that will vary greatly not just from country to country
          but also from school to school... With most regions it’s fairly
          standard for schools to include accommodation (either a 1/2 bed
          apartment or a fixed accommodation allowance), cover the cost of the
          flights, visas and medical insurance. Your salary will always be
          enough to live comfortably where you are, but how much you can save
          will depend on what you get paid, the cost of living and your
          lifestyle. If you have a savings goal let us know and we’ll advise
          where you can achieve it.
        </p>

        <h2 className="chapter-title-secondary">
          Can I take my family with me?
        </h2>
        <p>
          If you are planning on taking family with you’ll have reduced options
          compared to a single teacher as there are a lot of schools which don’t
          consider sponsorship of dependents. There will still be options but
          you may have to sacrifice on some things, such as location. If you
          have a (non-teacher) partner you will need to be married in order to
          be eligible to visa sponsor them. If you have children there are some
          schools which also provide free schooling, but if you have more than
          two children then it’s very unlikely you’ll find a school willing to
          go to the extra expense of hiring you.
        </p>

        <h2 className="chapter-title-secondary">Will I get a promotion?</h2>
        <p>
          It’s very rare that an international school will hire above your
          existing level of experience as there will be a lot for you to adapt
          to without having to worry about extra responsibilities. However, many
          of our schools are renowned for their career development and if
          promotion is something you are keen on you could be put on a path to
          take that next step much quicker than if you stayed at home.
        </p>

        <h2 className="chapter-title-secondary">
          Will the pupils speak English?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Don’t expect every child to be a native English speaker, every
          international school will have a large proportion of EAL students and
          in many cases the vast majority of students are EAL, however as the
          students will be used to receiving tuition in English and there are
          dedicated EAL departments and teaching assistants you’ll be able to
          teach effectively without learning the local language and particularly
          in Secondary you may well be impressed at just how well the students
          use English.
        </p>

        <h2 className="chapter-title-secondary">
          Why should I work with The Collobrative?
        </h2>
        <p>
          We have been dedicated international recruitment specialists for over
          a decade and are focussed on recruiting only for international
          schools, but are also part of Randstad which is one of the largest HR
          companies in the world, so we have the knowledge, systems and contacts
          to provide the best care to our teachers and schools. We have a
          vetting process for all the schools we work with and won’t recruit for
          schools who don’t treat their teachers properly.
        </p>

        <h2 className="chapter-title-secondary">
          Why do schools hire through you?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Our schools trust our judgement and know that when we send a teacher
          to them they will have been properly referenced and document checked
          so they can be as confident as possible in that teacher. We are also
          much more time effective for them as we only get them to look at
          checked and suitable applicants and we can save them money in the
          hiring process as well as finding them the best teachers!
        </p>

        <h2 className="chapter-title-secondary">What do you do for me?</h2>
        <p>
          You’ll have a consultative phone call with one of our team who will
          find out more about you and what you want as well as advising you on
          what your options will be given visa requirements and job
          availability. We’ll gather all your relevant documents and get your
          references - this only needs to be done once no matter how many jobs
          you apply for. After you’ve passed our compliance checks we’ll help
          with your CV, advise you about jobs and sprinkle some recruitment
          magic on your job search. We’ll give you interview tips, give expert
          advice if you have to choose between job offers and help you liaise
          with your new employer as well as answering any questions you have
          along the way… In short, we’ll do everything we can to help you find a
          job and make sure you are happy.
        </p>

        <h2 className="chapter-title-secondary">How do the interviews work?</h2>
        <p>
          The majority of jobs are interviewed for via a video call and it can
          be as quick as getting a job offer at your first interview or may take
          three or more interviews depending on the school. In some cases
          schools may fly their management team to locations around the world to
          conduct a number of interviews face-to-face which is a great
          opportunity if it works for you but as that only usually happens once
          per year you are much more likely to be interviewed on Skype (or other
          video call). We’ll give you tips and guidance ahead of your interview
          to help you impress.
        </p>

        <h2 className="chapter-title-secondary">
          How much do your recruitment services cost?
        </h2>
        <p>
          We won’t charge you anything to use our services and we’d recommend
          being very suspicious of any recruitment company that tries to take
          any money off of you! We get paid by the schools we recruit for and we
          generally work out cheaper for them than trying to recruit on their
          own because we are specialists and can work more efficiently with our
          teachers. The only costs you may have will be some small ones after
          you’ve accepted a job offer (such as document notarisation or medicals
          for visas) which are usually reimbursed by the school after you’ve
          arrived.
