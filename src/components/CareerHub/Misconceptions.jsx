        <p className="page-content-text-primary">
          So you are thinking about teaching abroad in international schools,
          and you have done some research. Think you know all about it? Maybe
          you do, but many teachers go abroad without really understanding the
          basics about International Schools! Read on to discover some of the
          most common misconceptions about teaching abroad.

      <div className="chapter-content-text">
        <h2 className="chapter-title">
          Misconception #1: I will be teaching English as a foreign language.
        </h2>
        <p>
          Not necessarily. Whilst there are a number of English Language schools
          that exist solely to teach English language to non-native English
          speakers, there is a very large and important category of schools that
          teach a full curriculum of all subjects. These schools, known as
          international schools, use various curricula such as the US, UK,
          Canadian, Australian and International Baccalaureate and teach all (or
          most) subjects in English. Whilst some of the pupils may not be
          English first language speakers, they are still expected to learn all
          or most subjects such as Maths, Science, Geography, Art and Physical
          Education, in English. In fact, a TEFL (teaching English as a Foreign
          Language) certificate is not required to work in International
          schools. They require approximately the same qualifications you would
          need to teach at home in a state-funded school.
        </p>
        <h2 className="chapter-title">
          Misconception #2: I can teach anywhere I want.
        </h2>
        <p>
          Teachers wishing to work overseas must meet regulations on two very
          different levels - teacher certification and immigration. Many
          teachers think that because they are qualified to teach at home, they
          can teach abroad and this is not always true. Each country has rules
          and requirements for the required training and experience and they
          might not match with your home country. For instance, teachers in
          South Africa without a 3 or 4 year teaching diploma will likely not be
          able to teach in the UAE. British Special Needs teachers without a
          university degree or certificate in Special Needs cannot teach Special
          Needs students in the Middle East or Asia. In China, teachers must
          have 2 years of experience to teach at all at international schools.
          And teachers without a teacher training degree such as a Bachelors of
          Education, Masters of Education, Higher Diploma in Education or Post
          Graduate Certificate in Education, can usually only work in English
          Language (TEFL) schools, not in International Schools.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now for immigration. As with certification, each country has its own
          set of rules about immigration and because you can travel to a country
          on a holiday does not mean you are allowed to work there. Some
          countries in the Middle East, for instance, will not issue a work visa
          to anyone whose first degree and teaching certificate are not matching
          and in your chosen subject specialism. Most countries in the European
          Union can only hire teachers with a European Union passport, excluding
          most teachers from the US, Canada, Australia, South Africa, New
          Zealand and since Brexit - UK too. American curriculum schools are the
          only exception to this rule – most of these schools are able to
          sponsor work permits though they usually take quite a long time. Most
          countries require police checks and will not issue visas to people
          with a criminal record (often zero tolerance in China for example).
          Further, if you are travelling with a family, countries differ on the
          work and immigration rights of a trailing spouse and most countries
          require that you are married in order to receive these rights at all.
          Therefore, if you are not married, your partner must have his or her
          own work authorisation through his or her own job.
        </p>
        <h2 className="chapter-title">
          Misconception #3: Everyone I work with will have the children’s best
          interest at heart.
        </h2>
        <p>
          Most international schools are privately owned, and whilst obviously
          schools are successful if children and their parents are happy, there
          are often competing forces within an international school that don’t
          exist in state-funded schools at home. As mainly for-profit
          enterprises, international schools must strike a balance between
          spending money to attract teachers, parents and produce good
          educational results against the income the school generates in school
          fees. This is not necessarily a bad thing, as well run international
          schools can adapt the efficiency of the business world with the joy of
          providing a service to children and parents, but some teachers might
          feel uncomfortable with the concept of a profit making educational
          enterprise. And there is a huge spectrum of schools – some are more
          ‘businesslike’ than others. International schools are as different as
          the children you teach – each one has a personality. Make sure your
          personalities are compatible!
        </p>
        <h2 className="chapter-title">
          Misconception #4: I will save loads of money because the salary is
          tax-free.
        </h2>
        <p>
          Firstly, tax-free salaries are only tax-free in the country in which
          you earn the money. Depending on the tax rules of your country of
          origin, you might still owe taxes on foreign-earned income back home.
          Some countries such as the US and UK might require that you are out of
          the country for more than 183 days in a tax year for a salary to be
          untaxed back home, whereas other countries have different
          requirements. Know the rules before you go so you don’t have any nasty
          surprises when you return.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, teachers cannot expect to make their current pre-tax salary
          everywhere in the world. Salaries will usually reflect the cost of
          living, and many schools take into account the added benefits of no
          tax payments and free housing so the basic salary will often appear
          lower than you might expect. This is why we encourage teachers to ‘do
          their sums’ with their current and overseas salary to find out what
          will be their final take home pay after all taxes, housing costs and
          transportation are taken into account. A basic salary of £35,000 in
          one’s home country where one pays tax and housing costs often results
          in far less money at the end of the month than with a tax free salary
          of £18,000 where housing and transport is provided.
        </p>
        <h2 className="chapter-title">
          Misconception #5: I can take it with me.
        </h2>
        <p>
          Living and working abroad means relocating those who depend on you –
          your partner, your dependents and your pets. It is important that you
          understand whether you can bring them with you and the implications.
          Because a teacher’s family will require a larger apartment, school
          fees (schooling is not always provided free to children of teachers –
          go back to Misconception #3 for more insight on this) and more
          on-costs which are not usually feasible on a teacher’s salary, most
          schools will often not consider a teacher with more than 1 child per
          teacher unless the teacher’s partner has found his/her own job with
          relocation benefits. And they can remain very cautious when you tell
          them “he/she will find work once we get there”.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our much loved pets are unfortunately another complication that can
          cause major problems abroad. Most countries require ‘pet visas’ which
          mean you must have a full immunisation and health record for your pet
          and some pets such as snakes or birds might be banned altogether.
          Culturally, we do not recommend that teachers wishing to move to South
          East Asia or the Middle East bring pets because, at best, they are not
          welcomed or catered for, and at worst, teachers might be unable to
          find accommodation which allows them. Therefore, teachers with pets
          need to declare this to their recruitment consultant or school so that
          you can find out if the culture or accommodation is appropriate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, before you go abroad, familiarise yourself with the rules of
          the country you are entering. Some countries prohibit the import of
          certain medicines, literature or other media so don’t get caught out.
        </p>
        <h2 className="chapter-title">
          Misconception #6: If I am teaching in a British or American school,
          all the children will be British or American.
        </h2>
        <p>
          The idea of international education appeals to many parents, not just
          expatriate ones. You will find in almost any international school that
          there is a broad range of nationalities. Some schools even serve a
          very local population of parents who want their children to have an
          education in English with an eye towards attending a western
          University or working in a multinational corporation. Most
          international schools, in fact, serve host nationals rather than
          expatriates so make sure you know the particulars of the school you
          are considering and what suits you.
        </p>
        <h2 className="chapter-title">
          Misconception #7: I am really ready for this!
        </h2>
        <p>
          Have you really thought this all out? Are you sure that you are
          flexible and adaptable enough to be able to relocate your life, your
          belongings, be separated from your family and friends all whilst
          starting a new job in a culture that you don’t yet understand? Do you
          need to rent out your house, put your possessions in storage and do
          you have enough money saved up to live until the first paycheque?
          Teaching abroad is not for everyone as it requires an enormous amount
          of adaptability, acceptance, preparation, optimism and most of all,
          resiliency. It is not for those who are insecure in themselves or
          their teaching, who give up easily or who expect it to be ‘the same as
          it was at home but with better scenery’. It is especially not for
          those looking for an easy life, as teachers working in private
          international schools need to know that parental and school
          expectations are high. Most international school positions require a 2
          or 3 year commitment, so teachers must be quite sure they are ready.
        </p>

          Yet despite all of the challenges and misconceptions, there are
          thousands of teachers happily living their dream of teaching abroad in
          exotic locations such as the Seychelles, Dubai, China, Spain and Peru.
        </p>
        <p>
          Teaching is one of the few professions where you can literally work
          your way around the world whilst developing professionally. Teaching
          abroad offers the opportunity for teachers to learn, grow and refresh
          themselves in their profession whilst teaching motivated children in
          exciting locations. The journey abroad must start somewhere, and
          reputable agencies such as TheCollaborativeAuckland offer their services and
          advice free of charge to teachers, providing a great place to start in
          your plan to “Teach the world and live the dream”!
